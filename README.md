# Python-Lockin-Amplifier

A set of functions to showcase and simulate the simple use of a lock in amplifier.

mySignalGeneration.py is used to build different signals. Ranging from simple sine waves to more complicated square wave. These functions can then be used to build more complicated signals.

myLockinAmplifier.py then has two classes. The lockinAmplifier class which holds the lock in amplifier function. There is also the examples class which simulates some concepts and the use of a lock in amplifier in multiple scenarios.
